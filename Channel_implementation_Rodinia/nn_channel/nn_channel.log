Kernels that do not use any work-item built-in functions, such as get_global_id(), are compiled for single
work-item execution (a task). Otherwise, a kernel is compiled as an ND-Range.

For tasks, the compiler will attempt to pipeline every loop in the kernel to allow multiple iterations of
the loop to execute concurrently. If some loops are not pipelined, or not pipelined well, you may not get
good performance.

For ND-Range kernels, the loops are not pipelined. Instead, they are built to accept multiple work-items
simultaneously. Kernel throughput is usually reduced by the largest total number of iterations of nested
loops. A large number of threads is usually required to efficiently utilize ND-Range kernels.

The kernel is compiled as an ND-Range.

The kernel was replicated 10 times due to num_compute_units attribute.
You should have at least three times as many work-groups as the number of compute units
to efficiently utilize all compute units.

The kernel has a required work-group size of (64, 1, 1).

System name: nn_channel

Channel Pairing Type Does not match
Channel c0 needs one chan_read_altera and one chan_write_altera.
Multiple chan_read_altera/chan_write_altera with the same channel ID may cause this problem.
system_integrator: custom_ic_impl.cpp:6957: void custom_ic::System::build_channel_system(): Assertion `0' failed.
